## Installation
The application simply requires a browser. Accessing the link below allows the user to begin scheduling calendar items and saving them for their next usage.

## Usage
Enter a task into the fields, and click the save button. This will keep the item in the field regardless of whether the browser window is closed and reopened. Tasks will be green if they are in the future, red if they are in the present, and greyed if they are in the past.
